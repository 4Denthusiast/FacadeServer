# FacadeServer

This is a headless (i.e. no graphics) application that runs the game as a server instance.
It can be administrated through a REST-based interface or a simple frontend that wraps around these API methods.
Administration comprises starting/stopping the host, configuring modules and the like.

In-game management (e.g. removing users from a running game) should be performed through users with admin rights.
